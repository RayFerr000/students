Hey Everyone,

My name is Bren Cavallo :person_with_blond_hair: and I'm a math PhD student at the CUNY Graduate Center.  
In terms of research I study group theory and applications to computational complexity and cryptography :computer: 

I also enjoy playing piano and watching live music :musical_note:.  Some of my recent recordings can be found [here] (https://soundcloud.com/bcavallo48).
